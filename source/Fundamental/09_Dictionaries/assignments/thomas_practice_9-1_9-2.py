Complete

This program is a roster management tool for a fictional football team: The ACC Riverbats ðŸ¦‡

The roster will be held in a dictionary with key-value pairing as: Full Name: Position
It will operate similarly to a CRUD endpoint, with options to create new entries,
read info on existing players, update existing data, and delete entries. Each CRUD
function will exist in a separate module and will be imported into main which will hold
the main program and menu functionality.
